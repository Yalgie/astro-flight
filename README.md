# Astro Flight

I built this game a few years ago with Phaser JS, It's an endless runner/flyer that progressively gets harder as time passes in the game, shoot the meteors as they come down the screen, collect health, and fuel your spaceship to keep yourself going.

I kind of forgot about it though and it eventually got taken down from the app stores due to not updating it. But it still lives on! Play it here: [https://thecodingforge.com.au/work/astro-flight](https://thecodingforge.com.au/work/astro-flight)
